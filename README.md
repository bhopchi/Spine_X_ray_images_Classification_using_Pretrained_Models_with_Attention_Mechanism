# Spine_X_ray_images_Classification_using_Pretrained_Models_with_Attention_Mechanism
Classification of spine X-ray images using pretrained CNNs (Xception, InceptionV3, DenseNet121) with an attention mechanism to focus on critical regions. The pipeline includes data balancing, augmentation, and model fine-tuning. Performance is evaluated with accuracy metrics and a confusion matrix.
